II. Key Concepts
----------------

Limited Vision
--------------
> Start off with either nothing or a flashlight 
> Players cannot perform any actions except moving if they can be seen by another player and cancel all actions if they are seen
> Vision can be upgraded by finding items/components, 
    + some will be temporary
> Sounds can be "heard"
    + a white circle will emanate from the source location and a sound will play 
    + without revealing who or what was there
    + possibly on deaths
? Players can interact with each other's light

Traps and weapons
-----------------
> Traps and weapons must be assembled from parts found in the mansion
> Killing requires that the other person doesn't know who did it, ie., doesn't have vision of them
> Traps can be static or can be setup by someone in an arbitrary location
    ? You need to activate the trap
    ? Can be automatic
? Not all traps/weapons kill, some disable

Treasure
--------
> Requires collecting components around the environment in order to find and access
> Only one of each component, requiring that you kill other players to steal components
> Some components need to be "solved", ie., they contain a puzzle element
    + Makes the solver vulnerable while solving

Secret-passages and Hiding Places
---------------------------------
> Change between games, so you have to discover them
> Secret passages lead to other places on the map
> Hiding places allow you to get behind someone or activate some trap

Two-sided Map
-------------
> One with the whole mansion
> One that shows only the secret passages you've discovered
> While in one map, you can't see/hear anything going on in the other
> Visually, the map will flip or rotate when entering/exiting a secret passage
